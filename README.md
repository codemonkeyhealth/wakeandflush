**Your first step to a healthy, happy day**

(See complete [Guide](http://codemonkeyhealth.com/the-code-monkey-health-guide/ "CMH Guide to Health for Programmers")  for even more info! [[also on GitHub](https://github.com/codemonkeyhealth/codemonkeyhealthguide "Code Monkey Health Guide on GitHub")])

#### Goal: ####
 
Drink 16 to 24 ounces of fresh filtered water immediately upon waking. Do this - literally - **before** your feet hit the floor.  If you forget, don't beat yourself up but do stop and chug some down.

#### Best practices: ####

Place appropriate sized container of water next to bed the night before.

#### Beginners: ####

If 16 to 24 ounces is too difficult begin by taking a large drink of water from the container.  This should result in a 1 to 2 ounce intake. Gradually work your way up to 16 to 24.  Even if you are beginning with less water, you should develop the habit with a container that will accommodate the full 16 to 24 ounces. You will be amazed at how much easier it is to work up to the full amount if you consistently have the full amount available.
